The goal of this project is to simplify getting started with Dojo, by greatly decreasing the number of files 
and concepts needed to become productive. Gone are the days of sorting through 20,000 files and their dependencies 
that might be needed to use Dojo.

* pre-defined, built/optimized layers for common sub packages of Dojo (a more logical mapping than the current 
  fragmented projects. All Javascript files included in the pre optimized layers are removed from the build output, 
  greatly reducing the overall number of JavaScript files needed to get started.
* pre-packaged themes (css files & associated resources) for mobile and desktop which have individual .css files 
  rolled up into aggregate CSS layer that's easy to include in HTML pages.
* pre-packaged localization bundles (multiple bundles, one per language, per major sub package of dojo)

The plan is to have prebuilt packages for the following dojo area:

AMD Loader (minimal, 4k)
Full Core
Common UI F/W
Desktop UI (dijit)
Desktop Theme: Claro (claro)(cross-platform)(optimized)
Mobile UI (dojox/mobile)
Mobile Theme: iOS (iPad/iPhone)(optimized)
Mobile Theme: Android (2.1-3.x)(optimized)
Mobile Theme: Blackberry (OS6)(optimized)
Mobile Theme: Mobile One UI (future)(cross-platform)(optimized)
Vector Graphics API (dojox/gfx)
Business Charting (dojox/charting and it's dependencies, with a single default nice looking theme)
Grid (gridx)
Gauges (dgauge)
Calendar (dojox/calendar)
Treemap (dojox/treemap)
Language packs
